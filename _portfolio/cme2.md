This project was carried out under the guidance of Dr. Devendraa Siingh (IITM Pune) and Dr. Jeni Victor (IITM Pune). The project aimed to mark changes in patterns of lightning/lightning flashes from April 2020 to March 2022  (the COVID-19 lockdown Period in India and neighboring countries) by comparing it to the older data. The entire analysis was carried out for the monsoon months of June, July, August, and September, using the data from NASA's Global Hydrometeorology Resource Center Distributed Active Archive Center (GHRC DAAC) TRMM LIS dataset. It was found that the area of major lightning flash concentration over West Bengal (India) , Bangladesh,  and parts of North Eastern India was slightly shifted towards the South-Western direction, likely to be correlated with a decrement in aerosol concentration.
