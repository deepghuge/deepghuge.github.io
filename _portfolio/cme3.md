In this project I implemented the [Reward Constrained Policy Optimization Paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SkfrvsA9FX) by Tessler et al. into stable-baselines3 implementation of PPO. Additionally, I reproduced the original results by tracking my experiments using weights and biases. The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/sudo-Boris/stable-baselines3). I also wrote an article elaborating on the theory of RCPO and my results and submitted it to the ICLR Blogposts Track! You can fin the article [here](https://iclr-blogposts.github.io/staging/blog/2023/Adaptive-Reward-Penalty-in-Safe-Reinforcement-Learning/)
