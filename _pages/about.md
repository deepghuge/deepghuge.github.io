<!--👨🏻‍💻 I'm a BS-MS dual degree student at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune.

🔬 I'm interested in the confluence of astronomy, data science, and statistics.

📚 I am presently doing my Master's thesis focused on characterizing Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) Sheaths.

📽️ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Machine Learning and academia.-->
I’m passionate about the confluence of astronomy, data science, and statistics. My core interests have always revolved
around observational astronomy and plasma physics. I specialize in modeling and analyzing the data from the Sun and
other astrophysical systems. My research interest lies in analyzing heliophysical data to uncover underlying physical
phenomena and, furthermore, look at their impact on Earth’s geophysical systems. Given an opportunity, I would be
keen on developing or organizing a platform that presents scientific data and findings in a simplified manner, with the
aim of promoting science education among the general public.

# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal.

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** at the Reliable Multimodal AI Lab at the TU Darmstadt under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Rohrbach.
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I worked on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content.
