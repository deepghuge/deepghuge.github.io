🔭 I'm a BS-MS dual degree student at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune. 
I am particularly drawn to the intersection of astronomy, data science, and statistics, finding great satisfaction in working at their confluence.

😎 I am presently doing my Master's thesis on characterizing Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) Sheaths under the supervision of Prof. Prasad Subramanian (IISER Pune). 

📑My research interest involves analyzing heliophysical data to unveil underlying physical phenomena. Additionally, exploring their impact on Earth's geophysical systems.
