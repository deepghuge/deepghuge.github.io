🔭 I'm a BS-MS dual degree student at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune. 
I am particularly drawn to the intersection of astronomy, data science, and statistics, and I find great satisfaction in working at their confluence.

🌞 I am presently doing my Master's thesis on characterizing Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) Sheaths under the supervision of Prof. Prasad Subramanian (IISER Pune). 

📑 My research interest involves analyzing heliophysical data to unveil underlying physical phenomena. Additionally, exploring their impact on Earth's geophysical systems.

🧑‍💻 As a fervent technophile, I also possess proficiency to a degree in web automation and web development. I like to talk about the specific problems that I was able to solve in my blogs. Make sure to check out my blogs!
