I'm a BS-MS dual degree student at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune. 
I am particularly drawn to the intersection of astronomy, data science, and statistics, finding great satisfaction in working at their confluence.

Presently doing my Master's thesis focused on characterizing Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) Sheaths under the supervision of Prof. Prasad Subramanian (IISER Pune). My research interest lies in analyzing heliophysical data to uncover underlying physical phenomena and, furthermore, look at their impact on Earth’s geophysical systems.
